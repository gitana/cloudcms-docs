    <h1>Connecting to Cloud CMS</h1>

    <br/>

    <p>
        To connect to Cloud CMS, you need to establish two important pieces of information:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The client that you are connecting as</li>
        <li>The user that you are signing on as</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The only way that a remote application can connect to your platform is if it can produce the correct
        credentials to identify itself as a client that you know about.  As the platform administrator, you issue
        a client key/secret ahead of time.  The application then needs to present these credentials to you and
        prove that it is who it says it is.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Once the server can trust that the application is who it says it is (and not someone who is trying to
        access your platform independently), the user of your application then needs to log in.  The user must
        present their own credentials (usually something like a username and password) and the server must check
        things out and then sign them on.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        That's basically how it works.  However, we've kept things pretty simple.  Cloud CMS provides a number of
        configurations and authentication flows so that you avoid exposing secret credentials and keep things working
        in a very secure manner.
    </p>

    <h2>Simple Connection using OAuth2 "Password" Flow</h2>
    <p>
        Let's take a simple example of how you might connect to Cloud CMS using the OAuth2 "password" flow.  This
        flow connects over HTTPS so as to provide a strong guarantee that data won't be picked off by a man-in-the-middle
        attack.  That said, it also hard codes client secret and user password into the source code.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Not a good thing you say?  Very astute observation.  We cover this below.
    <p>
        Let's take a look at how this might work.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="connect1"></div>
    <p>
        This creates an instance of the Gitana driver (that's the name of the driver that connects to Cloud CMS).
        This instance will perform an authentication handshake to assert the identity of the client to the server.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        However, it hasn't done this yet.  We first need to provide the other bit of information - our user identity.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The simplest way to connect is to simply pass over the username and password of a principal on your platform.
        For example, here we pass in the username and password of a principal named "frodo".
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="connect2"></div>
    <p>
        The authentication call will tell the Gitana driver to perform an OAuth2 handshake using the "password" flow.
        When the handshake completes, you driver will have an OAuth2 <b>access token</b> and <b>refresh token</b>.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        And so, now you can just go crazy with the cheese whiz.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="connect3"></div>

    <br/>

    <h2>Access Tokens and Refresh Tokens</h2>
    <p>
        When you authenticate using the Gitana driver, the Cloud CMS server issues you an OAuth access token and
        refresh token.  With every subsequent operation that gets performed, the driver will automatically apply
        your access token as stuff gets sent over the wire.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Eventually, your access token will expire.  This is normal.  It's actually a safety mechanism built into the
        OAuth2 protocol.  That way, if someone sniffed your access token, there's a short window that they can use it
        before it becomes invalid.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        When your access token invalidates, the Gitana driver will automatically perform another handshake with the
        Cloud CMS server using your refresh token (via the OAuth2 "refresh" flow).  In this way, the Gitana driver
        will acquire a new access token and begin using it.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        This all happens automatically for you behind the scenes.  That way, you don't have to manually manage any
        tokens or handle any weird 401's that pop out of nowhere.  It's all taken care of for you.
    </p>

    <h2>Security Concerns for JavaScript in the Browser</h2>
    <p>
        If you're running JavaScript in the browser, then the example above should really be for testing and nothing
        more.  Why?  Well, the main reason is that we're storing the client secret and user password in our source code.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Anyone can view the source of a browser application and find the client secret or password.  All you would have
        to do is "View Source" and there it is.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        There are all kinds of tricks and games you can play to try to obfuscate the data but, in the end, it's just
        a bad practice to expose the client secret or the user password.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Fortunately, Cloud CMS supports all of the OAuth2 Flows.  The "password" flow is just one of them.  It's really
        intended for compiled or server-side applications (like Java, Android, iOS, NodeJS or even compiled Appcelerator
        Titanium apps).  In all of those cases, it's really hard to get at the source.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        For JavaScript/HTML5 applications running in a browser, we recommend the OAuth2 "code" authorization flow.
        You can read more about that in the next section.

    <h2>Gitana Options</h2>
    <p>
        There are a few additional options you can specify when instantiating the Gitana driver.
        Here is a full list of what you can specify:
    </p>
    <table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
        <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Property</th>
            <th>Type</th>
            <th>Default</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>clientId</td>
            <td>text</td>
            <td></td>
            <td>
                The client key.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>clientSecret</td>
            <td>text</td>
            <td></td>
            <td>
                The client secret.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>baseURL</td>
            <td>text</td>
            <td>/proxy</td>
            <td>
                Sets the location of the Cloud CMS API.  Due to same-domain policies within the browser, this is set
                to <code>/proxy</code> by default.  You must set up a proxy server at "/proxy" that points to
                <code>https://api.cloudcms.com</code> to run within a browser.  If you're running in a native
                or server-side environment, you can set this to <code>https://api.cloudcms.com</code> directly.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>locale</td>
            <td>text</td>
            <td></td>
            <td>
                Sets the value of the <code>accepts-language</code> header on any calls back to the Cloud CMS
                server.  This header is used by the server to automatically localize any I18N-enabled translations
                on content (nodes).
            </td>
        </tr>

        </tbody>
    </table>
