    <h1>Platform</h1>
    <p>
        When you authenticate to Cloud CMS, you are given access to your platform.  You can only authenticate to one
        platform at a time.  This is because clients are scoped to a single platform.  When you authenticate using
        a client key and secret, you inform the Gitana driver which platform to connect to.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your platform provides access to all of the underlying data stores and platform-scoped objects.  You can
        also store data on your platform data store itself, if you wish.
    </p>
