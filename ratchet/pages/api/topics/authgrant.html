    <p>
        An Authentication Grant provides a way for you to generate alternate credentials for authenticating as a user
        to a platform.  These alternate credentials consist of a key and a secret (much like a client's key and secret).
        You can use this key and secret in the same places where you might otherwise use a username and password.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Why would you want to use an Authentication Grant?  Here are a few reasons:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Authentication Grants provide a way for you to distribute user authentication credentials without actually
            having to give out the usernames and passwords of your users.
        </li>
        <li>
            Authentication Grants are constrained to specific users AND specific clients.  Thus, if someone hacks around
            and manages to figure out your Authentication Grant's key and secret, they are still constrained to only
            accessing a single platform as a single client and user.
        </li>
        <li>
            If your Authentication Grant's key and secret are compromised (i.e. someone hacked around, figured out what
            the key/secret is and started trying to do malicious things), you can disable the Authentication Grant.
            This doesn't affect the user or the client.  But the Authentication Grant is shut down.  Booyah.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Authentication Grants are also configurable so that you can enhance and control their security characteristics.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        For example, by chaining to a specific client, you can specify exactly which OAuth2 Authorization Flows
        an Authentication Grant can participate in (by tightening security around the client).  In this way, you could
        do things like limit access only for those who authorize using the full "authentication code" OAuth2 Flow
        (which is the most secure, in our view, of all flows).
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Or, you might opt to allow for reduced security for certain grants that you know are being used by trusted
        domains.  Authentication Grants can be configured for <b>Open Driver</b> authentication which is a variant of
        the OAuth2 "password" Flow intended for JavaScript/HTML5 applications.
    </p>

    <!-- CONFIGURATION -->
    <h2>Configuration</h2>
    <p>
        Authentication Grants maintain a configuration that you can adjust or consult as you create, update
        and query for them.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The following table presents you the configuration properties.
    </p>
    <table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
        <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Property</th>

        </tbody>
    </table>


    <h2 id="create">Create an Authentication Grant</h2>
    <p>
        To create an Authentication Grant, we first have to have a Client and a Domain User.  Remember that an
        Authentication Grant is basically a permission slip that lets someone come along and impersonate the
        Domain User provided that they are using the right Client.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        We just have to provide a few details.  It's basically as simple as this:
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="create1"></div>
    <p>
        Note that the Authentication Grant key and secret are automatically generated for us.  In fact, this is a really
        important detail since the server uses an encryption algorithm to generate the secret (using a cipher that is
        unique per platform).
    </p>

    <h2 id="update">Update an Authentication Grant</h2>
    <p>
        To update, all you have to do is make changes to your Authentication Grant and fire away.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="update1"></div>
    <p>
        You are not allowed to update the <code>key</code> or <code>secret</code> fields.  These are Read-Only.
        If you'd like to change the key or secret, you must create a new Authentication Grant.
    </p>

    <h2 id="delete">Delete an Authentication Grant</h2>
    <p>
        When you delete an Authentication Grant, any users of any applications that were authenticated using the
        Authentication Grant's credentials will no longer have access to your platform.  They'll be shut down.  The
        server will additionally clean up any OAuth2 access or refresh tokens.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Thus, the effect is pretty much instantaneous.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="delete1"></div>
    <h3 id="disable">Disabling</h3>
    <p>
        As an alternative to deleting, you might opt to disable the Authentication Grant.  The effect is basically the
        same but you will have the option to re-enable or reuse the Authentication Grant at some point in the future.
        It's really up to you.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="disable1"></div>

    <h2 id="read">Read an Authentication Grant</h2>
    <p>
        You can read an Authentication Grant by its <code>_doc</code> ID field.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="read1"></div>

    <!-- LIST -->

    <h2 id="list">List Authentication Grants</h2>
    <p>
        You can retrieve a list of Authentication Grants for your platform quite easily.
        The following code hands back the full list.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="list1"></div>
    <p>
        You can then iterate over the list to pick at what you'd like.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="list2"></div>
    <p>
        Retrieving the full list is potentially an expensive operation, depending how many items you have.
        The more your retrieve, the more data goes over the wire and so forth.  Thus, you might wish to
        <i>paginate</i> your call and retrieve a subset of the total list at a time.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Here is an example that retrieves in pages of size 10.
        It starts on the second page (by skipping to starting index 20).
        It also sorts by the <code>title</code> field in a descending sequence.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="list3"></div>
    <p>
        You don't have to have all of the pagination parameters (<code>limit</code>, <code>skip</code> and <code>sorting</code>).
        You might only want to include one or two.  It's up to you.
    </p>



    <!-- QUERY -->

    <h2 id="query">Query Authentication Grants</h2>
    <p>
        You can run custom queries against your Authentication Grants to find exactly what you're looking for.
        Here is a query that looks for Authentication Grants which are disabled.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="query1"></div>
    <p>
        Here is that same query followed by an iteration over the result map.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="query2"></div>
    <p>
        Finally, you can mix queries with pagination to reduce data over the wire and speed up performance.
        Here is that same query with some pagination thrown in.
        We limit to pages of size 10 and sort by <code>title</code>.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="query3"></div>
