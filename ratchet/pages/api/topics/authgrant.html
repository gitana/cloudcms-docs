    <h2>Authentication Grant</h2>
    <p>
        With authentication grants, you can define alternative credentials for signing onto Cloud CMS.  These credentials
        consist of a username and password.  They allow a single to sign on as a specific user against a predetermined client.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Authentication grants are recommended for all applications that intend to hardcode their credentials into the app.
        If you those credentials should become compromised, you retain the option of disabling the authentication grant at any time.
        This is far preferrable to putting raw principal credentials out in the open.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        In addition, authentication grants provides additional safety measures around their use.  You can constraint them
        to specific authentication flows, pre-described domain URLs and more.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Authentication grants are objects which are stored in the platform.
