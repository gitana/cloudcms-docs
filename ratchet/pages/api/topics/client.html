    <p>
        A Client defines an entry point for applications to connect to your platform.  Applications utilize a
        key and secret to identify themselves as a particular client of your platform.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        You can have as many Clients as you would like.  Each client has a key/secret combination which the calling
        application will need to provide in order to assert their identity as the client.  This prevents unknown
        applications from using your platform without your knowledge.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Clients supports the OAuth2 authentication flows.  You can specify for each Client which flows you intend for
        it to support.  You can also enable Open Driver authentication support for JavaScript/HTML5 applications
        running on the Cloud CMS hosted tier.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Finally, you can at any point disable Clients if you suspect they are being tampered with or if you decide
        you would like to issue new credentials.
    </p>

                It is not required.  OAuth2 allows the redirect URI to be passed in by the originating authorize request.
                However, if you want tighter security, you can specify the redirect URI here and enforce redirects
                only back to known pages.

                If you're using Open Driver authentication, then this is an array of URLs which identify valid
                HTTP "Referrer" (spelling) headers for the incoming request.  This allows for a safety check to
                help ensure that the client application is running at a known address.

                <br/>
                Note: This is only a safeguard.  But it isn't foolproof.  It's still possible for malicious clients
                to fake HTTP "Referrer" headers if they wanted to.  If you detect misuse of Client keys, you can
                disable the client and issue a new one.

                If true, then Cloud CMS will automatically approve the requested scopes when the user

                confirmation page where they can authorize the requested scopes.  This skips that step.
                After authenticating, the scopes are automatically approved and the browser is redirected to the
                redirect URI.

    <h2 id="create">Create a Client</h2>
    <p>
        You can create as many Clients as you would like.  Each Client is essentially a "door" with a lock that lets
        anyone who has the keys sign on to your platform.  Each Client has a public key and a private secret.  For
        a fully-secure authorization flow, the application that aspires to sign on as the Client will need to
        provide the key and secret during the authorization handshake.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Here is how you create a Client:
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="create1"></div>
    <p>
        The key and secret are generated for us.  You cannot specify the key and/or secret by hand.
        In fact, this is a really important detail since the server uses an encryption algorithm to
        generate the secret (using a cipher that is unique per platform).
    </p>
    <p>
        Here we create a Client that only allows for the "authorization_code" (3-legged) flow.  If an application tries
        to authorize with this Client using any other OAuth2 flow, they'll be rejected.  This example also contains a
        preconfigured redirect uri for a known entry page that we trust.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="create2"></div>
    <p>
        And here is an example of a Client that utilizes the "Open Driver" authentication scheme.  This is a Cloud CMS
        supported variation of the "password" flow whereby we do not require the client secret to authenticate.
        Thus, we don't need the client secret anywhere in the source code of the application.  This is ideal for
        HTML5 and JavaScript applications running in the browser.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        In place of the client secret, we check the incoming domain URL to identify the application.
        The <code>domainUrls</code> array lets us define valid domain URLs on which the application may be running.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="create3"></div>

    <h2 id="update">Update a Client</h2>
    <p>
        To update, all you have to do is make changes to your Client and fire away.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="update1"></div>
    <p>
        You are not allowed to update the <code>key</code> or <code>secret</code> fields.  These are Read-Only.
        If you'd like to change the key or secret, you must create a new Client.
    </p>

    <h2 id="delete">Delete a Client</h2>
    <p>
        When you delete an Client, any users of any applications that were authenticated using the
        Client's credentials will no longer have access to your platform.  They'll be shut down.  The
        server will additionally clean up any OAuth2 access or refresh tokens.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Thus, the effect is pretty much instantaneous.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="delete1"></div>
    <h3 id="disable">Disabling</h3>
    <p>
        As an alternative to deleting, you might opt to disable the Client.  The effect is basically the
        same but you will have the option to re-enable or reuse the Client at some point in the future.
        It's really up to you.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="disable1"></div>

    <h2 id="read">Read a Client</h2>
    <p>
        You can read a Client by its <code>_doc</code> ID field.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="read1"></div>

    <h2 id="list">List Clients</h2>
    <p>
        You can retrieve a list of Clients for your platform quite easily.
        The following code hands back the full list.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="list1"></div>
    <p>
        You can then iterate over the list to pick at what you'd like.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="list2"></div>
    <p>
        Retrieving the full list is potentially an expensive operation, depending how many items you have.
        The more your retrieve, the more data goes over the wire and so forth.  Thus, you might wish to
        <i>paginate</i> your call and retrieve a subset of the total list at a time.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Here is an example that retrieves in pages of size 10.
        It starts on the second page (by skipping to starting index 20).
        It also sorts by the <code>title</code> field in a descending sequence.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="list3"></div>
    <p>
        You don't have to have all of the pagination parameters (<code>limit</code>, <code>skip</code> and <code>sorting</code>).
        You might only want to include one or two.  It's up to you.
    </p>

    <h2 id="query">Query Clients</h2>
    <p>
        You can run custom queries against your Clients to find exactly what you're looking for.
        Here is a query that looks for Clients which are disabled.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="query1"></div>
    <p>
        Here is that same query followed by an iteration over the result map.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="query2"></div>
    <p>
        Finally, you can mix queries with pagination to reduce data over the wire and speed up performance.
        Here is that same query with some pagination thrown in.
        We limit to pages of size 10 and sort by <code>title</code>.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="query3"></div>
