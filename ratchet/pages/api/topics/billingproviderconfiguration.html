        Cloud CMS provides integration with billing providers
        (such as <a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com">Braintree Payments</a>) so that you can provide
        subscription-level billing for your sub-tenants.  This billing may include base subscription prices,
        discounts and addons.  It also may include <i>metered billing</i> in which your tenants are billed at
        the end of a plan's billing period for any accumulated storage or data transfer.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        If this sounds familiar, it's because it's exactly what Cloud CMS uses to supports its own subscription
        plans for Cloud CMS customers.  Just as we bill our customers for metered usage of the platform, you are
        free to pass those costs downstream to your own clients.  And you can use the very same technical
        capabilities and facilities to do so.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Cloud CMS offers billing provider integration that is compatible with the APIs and client libraries made
        available by the billing providers themselves.  These billing providers will issue you some credentials
        (such as a public/private key and a merchant account id).  You can use those on your own, in your own code
        and in your own products.  However, you can also plug those values into Cloud CMS and Cloud CMS can manage
        the platform-level billing for you.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        A Billing Provider Configuration is a place where you store those values.  Each Billing Provider Configuration
        will differ slightly depending on what the individual billing provider needs to store.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        We will be adding more billing provider support as it is requested.

    <!-- CONFIGURATION -->
    <h2>Configuration</h2>
    <p>
        Billing Provider Configurations will vary from provider to provider, however there are some properties which
        are in common among all of them.  Those properties along with any custom properties by provider type
        are shown below:

    <h2 id="create">Create a Billing Provider Configuration</h2>
    <p>
        You can create as many billing provider configurations as you would like.  Billing Provider Configurations
        are stored within your platform and are used by your platform's registrar data stores to handle subscriptions
        for any tenants contained therein.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        As such, you probably won't have too many billing provider configurations but you might have multiple if, for
        example, you wish to switch between test and production configurations.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Here is an example that creates a configuration for Braintree Payments.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="create1"></div>

    <h2 id="update">Update a Billing Provider Configuration</h2>
    <p>
        There's really nothing to it.  You can modify the properties of your billing provider configuration
        as you see fit.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="update1"></div>

    <h2 id="delete">Delete a Billing Provider Configuration</h2>
    <p>
        You can delete billing provider configurations as you wish.  If a billing provider configuration is presently
        in use by a registrar, this will throw back at you (a good thing).
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="delete1"></div>

    <h2 id="read">Read a Billing Provider Configuration</h2>
    <p>
        You can read a Billing Provider Configuration by its <code>_doc</code> ID field or by its <code>key</code>
        field.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="read1"></div>

    <h2 id="list">List Billing Provider Configurations</h2>
    <p>
        You can retrieve a list of Billing Provider Configurations for your platform quite easily.
        The following code hands back the full list.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="list1"></div>
    <p>
        You can then iterate over the list to pick at what you'd like.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="list2"></div>
    <p>
        Retrieving the full list is potentially an expensive operation, depending how many items you have.
        The more your retrieve, the more data goes over the wire and so forth.  Thus, you might wish to
        <i>paginate</i> your call and retrieve a subset of the total list at a time.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Here is an example that retrieves in pages of size 10.
        It starts on the second page (by skipping to starting index 20).
        It also sorts by the <code>title</code> field in a descending sequence.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="list3"></div>
    <p>
        You don't have to have all of the pagination parameters (<code>limit</code>, <code>skip</code> and <code>sorting</code>).
        You might only want to include one or two.  It's up to you.
    </p>

    <h2 id="query">Query Billing Provider Configurations</h2>
    <p>
        You can run custom queries against your Billing Provider Configurations to find exactly what you're looking for.
        Here is a query that looks for Billing Provider Configurations for "braintree".
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="query1"></div>
    <p>
        Here is that same query followed by an iteration over the result map.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="query2"></div>
    <p>
        Finally, you can mix queries with pagination to reduce data over the wire and speed up performance.
        Here is that same query with some pagination thrown in.
        We limit to pages of size 10 and sort by <code>title</code>.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="query3"></div>
