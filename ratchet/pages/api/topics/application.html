    <p>
        A domain is a data store where you can store users, groups and memberships.
    </p>


    <!-- CONFIGURATION -->
    <h2>Configuration</h2>
    <p>
        As with all data stores, domains maintain a configuration document that contains system
        and custom properties.  You can write your own properties onto this configuration document if you wish.
        You might use those properties to query and retrieve the domain at a later time.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Some system properties are read-only and others are writable.  You can adjust the writable properties
        to modify the behavior and characteristics of the domain.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The following table presents you the system properties.
    </p>
    <h4>Data Store Properties</h4>
    <div gadget="include" page="pages/api/topics/shared/datastore-config-table"></div>
    <p>
        Any system properties that are shown to be Read-Only are not modifiable on calls to <code>create()</code> or <code>update()</code>.
        Anything else is fair game.
    </p>




    <!-- CREATE -->

    <h2 id="create">Create a Domain</h2>
    <p>
        You can create an empty domain like this:
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="create1"></div>

    <p>
        Or you can pass in configuration which will be applied to the domain.  You can pass in
        any properties you'd like.  These properties will become part of the domain configuration and you
        can utilize that however you'd like.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="create2"></div>
    <p>
        Here is an example where we create a domain and then immediately display a property and then update it.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="create3"></div>



    <!-- UPDATE -->

    <h2 id="update">Update a Domain</h2>
    <p>
        To update a domain, you just adjust its properties and then tell the server to update.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="update1"></div>
    <p>
        Here is an example that creates a domain and then immediately updates it.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="update2"></div>



    <!-- DELETE -->

    <h2 id="delete">Delete a Domain</h2>
    <p>
        Once you delete a domain, it's gone for good.
        If you're not sure whether you'll need it again in the future, you might want to archive it first.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Here is an example of a simple delete.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="delete1"></div>
    <p>
        And here is an example where we create, update and then delete.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="delete2"></div>




    <!-- READ -->

    <h2 id="read">Read a Domain</h2>
    <p>
        Reading a domain is really quite simple provided that you know what you're looking for.
        You retrieve domains by their ID - the <code>_doc</code> field.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="read1"></div>
    <p>
        Granted, in many cases you won't know the domain ID off-hand.  You'll likely need to look up the
        domain ID ahead of time by some other means.  Read further on this page for examples of how you
        can do this.
    </p>



    <!-- LIST -->

    <h2 id="list">List Domains</h2>
    <p>
        You can retrieve a list of domains for your platform quite easily.
        The following code hands back the full list.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="list1"></div>
    <p>
        You can then iterate over the list to pick at what you'd like.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="list2"></div>
    <p>
        Retrieving the full list is potentially an expensive operation, depending how many domains you have.
        The more your retrieve, the more data goes over the wire and so forth.  Thus, you might wish to
        <i>paginate</i> your call and retrieve a subset of the total list at a time.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Here is an example that retrieves in pages of size 10.
        It starts on the second page (by skipping to starting index 20).
        It also sorts by the <code>title</code> field in a descending sequence.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="list3"></div>
    <p>
        You don't have to have all of the pagination parameters (<code>limit</code>, <code>skip</code> and <code>sorting</code>).
        You might only want to include one or two.  It's up to you.
    </p>



    <!-- QUERY -->

    <h2 id="query">Query Domains</h2>
    <p>
        You can run custom queries against your domains to find exactly what you're looking for.
        Here is a query that looks for domains whose field <code>country</code> is <code>"USA"</code>.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="query1"></div>
    <p>
        Here is that same query followed by an iteration over the result map.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="query2"></div>
    <p>
        Cloud CMS utilizes the MongoDB query syntax under the hood.  As such, you can really go to town.
        You're able to express queries with some pretty rich complexity.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Here is a query that finds all domains created after July 4, 2012.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="query3"></div>
    <p>
        Finally, you can mix queries with pagination to reduce data over the wire and speed up performance.
        Here is that same query with some pagination thrown in.  We limit to pages of size 10 and sort by <code>title</code>.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="query4"></div>
