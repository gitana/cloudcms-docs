    <p>
        A Domain User is a principal that describes a single person or user within the membership hierarchy of the
        domain.  Domain Users are endpoints in the hierarchy.  They may belong to one or more
        <a href="#/api/domaingroup/${language}">Domain Groups</a>.
        A Domain User is allowed to authenticate via the Cloud CMS authentication services and therefore maintains
        security credentials on an
        <a href="#/api/identity/${language}">Identity</a>.  An Identity holds the encrypted password or tokens for the
        Domain User along with credentials on other systems (such as third-party social systems).  As such, multiple
        Domain Users across many Domains may, in fact, maintain a common Single-Sign-On (SSO) identity.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The Cloud CMS authority and permission systems utilize the membership hierarchy to determine the full set of
        authorities that a user has been granted against an object or data store.  If a group is granted an authority,
        then the members of that group inherit the grants.  This inheritance propagates down the chain until
        all of the child nodes are affected.
    </p>


    <!-- CONFIGURATION -->
    <h2>Configuration</h2>
    <p>
        Domain Users maintain a configuration that you can adjust or consult as you create, update and query for them.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The following table presents you the configuration properties.
    </p>
    <table class="table table-bordered table-striped">

            <td>
                The name (i.e. the user id or account name) for the principal.  This can be any text that you
                like.  However, it must be unique across all users in the domain.  For example, you cannot have two
                users in the domain with the name "joe".

            <td>
                The type of principal - either <code>USER</code> or <code>GROUP</code>.
                This value is auto-populated upon creation.

            <td>
                An array of text describing the authorities that this user should be granted.  This is customizable
                for your own use and describes server-scoped authorities.  Cloud CMS does not use this array for
                any of its internal authority calculations against objects or data stores.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                Cloud CMS makes this available for use with such frameworks as Spring Security or Ruby on Rails
                where the list of authorities can be consulted to determine rights against specific controllers
                or services at invocation time.

    <h2 id="create">Create a Domain User</h2>
    <p>
        You create a Domain User by passing in a configuration object that contains, at minimum, the
        <code>name</code> of the user being created.  The <code>name</code> of the user must be unique across all
        principals in the domain.  You cannot have two users with the same <code>name</code> in the same domain.
        Similarly, you cannot have a user and a group with the same <code>name</code> in the same domain.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Here is how you create a Domain User:
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="create1"></div>
    <p>
        You can provide additional properties and also custom properties at the point of creation.
        Here is an example of you'd do that:
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="create2"></div>
    <p>
        Domain Users also support authentication.  This means that they can authenticate to your cloud platform
        and your applications can provide safely store usernames and passwords while providing login services
        like password resets, email confirmations and the like.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        It's easy to create a user with a password.  Here's an example:
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="create3"></div>




    <h2 id="update">Update a Domain User</h2>
    <p>
        To update, all you have to do is make changes to your Domain User and fire away.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="update1"></div>
    <p>
        You can update any property you'd like from the domain user except for the <code>type</code>.  You cannot
        switch a group into a user or vice-versa.  While both Domain Groups and Domain Users are Domain Principals,
        they're not interchangeable.
    </p>




    <h2 id="delete">Delete a Domain User</h2>
    <p>
        You can delete a Domain User at any time.  All memberships of the Domain User within Domain Groups will
        be cleaned up as well.  If any Identities associated with a Domain User are no longer needed, they will
        also be cleaned up.

        Here is an example:
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="delete1"></div>



    <h2 id="read">Read a Domain User</h2>
    <p>
        You can read a Domain User by its <code>_doc</code> ID field.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="read1"></div>




    <h2 id="list">List Domain Users</h2>
    <p>
        You can retrieve a list of Domain Users for your domain quite easily.
        The following code hands back the full list.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="list1"></div>
    <p>
        You can then iterate over the list to pick at what you'd like.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="list2"></div>
    <p>
        Retrieving the full list is potentially an expensive operation, depending how many items you have.
        The more your retrieve, the more data goes over the wire and so forth.  Thus, you might wish to
        <i>paginate</i> your call and retrieve a subset of the total list at a time.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Here is an example that retrieves in pages of size 10.
        It starts on the second page (by skipping to starting index 20).
        It also sorts by the <code>title</code> field in a descending sequence.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="list3"></div>
    <p>
        You don't have to have all of the pagination parameters (<code>limit</code>, <code>skip</code> and <code>sorting</code>).
        You might only want to include one or two.  It's up to you.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition, you can retrieve a full list of principals (both users and groups) by using a
        more generalized approach to list principals.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="list4"></div>




    <h2 id="query">Query Domain Users</h2>
    <p>
        You can run custom queries against your Domain Users to find exactly what you're looking for.
        Here is a query that looks for Domain Users which are disabled.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="query1"></div>
    <p>
        Here is that same query followed by an iteration over the result map.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="query2"></div>
    <p>
        You can mix queries with pagination to reduce data over the wire and speed up performance.
        Here is that same query with some pagination thrown in.
        We limit to pages of size 10 and sort by <code>title</code>.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="query3"></div>
    <p>
        In addition, you can query against the full set of principals (both users and groups) by using a
        more generalized approach to query principals.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="query4"></div>
