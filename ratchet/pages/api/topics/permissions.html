    <h1>Permissions</h1>
    <p>
        Every data store and object in Cloud CMS maintains access control lists so that you can finely describe the
        rights of any principal in the system against it.  This lets you finely tune the rights of individual users
        against data stores and objects down to a single permission.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        This access control is authority-based which means that it's applied by granting authorities (or roles) that
        a principal has over an object.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Let's buckle down on the terminology for a moment:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            A <b>Permissioned</b> entity is a data store or object that the permissions service knows how to work with.
            As noted, this includes absolutely everything within Cloud CMS.
        </li>
        <li>
            A <b>Principal</b> is the user or person acting upon a Permissioned.
        </li>
        <li>
            A <b>Permission</b> is a capability that you can grant to a principal.
        </li>
        <li>
            An <b>Authority</b> is a Role that packages together multiple permissions.  When you grant a principal an
            authority over an object or data store, all of the permissions of that authority are in turn granted.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Let's take a look at the list of permissions:
    </p>
    <table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
        <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Permission</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>CONNECT</td>
            <td>The principal can connect to a Permissioned.  This permission supercedes all others.  If not granted, the principal is not aware of the Permissioned and can perform no operations against it.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>READ</td>
            <td>The principal can read the Permissioned.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>CREATE_SUBOBJECTS</td>
            <td>The principal can create objects that are contained within the Permissioned.</td>
        </tr>

            <td>The principal can update the Permissioned.</td>

            <td>MODIFY_PERMISSIONS</td>
            <td>The principal can assign, revoke and modify permissions against the Permissioned.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>GRANTAUTH</td>
            <td>The principal can assign impersonating around another principal.  This is solely used for Authentication Grants as a means of describing who can create new grants for a principal.</td>

        <tr>

    <h2>Assign Permission</h2>
    <p>
        Cloud CMS does not let you assign individual permissions to data stores or objects.  Instead, permissions
        are collected together into Roles/Authorities.  When a principal is granted a Role over a data store or
        object, they are granted all of the roles' permissions.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        See the section on Authorities for information on working with role-based security.
    </p>


    <h2>Check Permission</h2>
    <p>
        We can check whether a principal has a given permission over a datastore or object by making a simple
        call over to the server to ask.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="check1"></div>
    <p>
        Bear in mind that this approach makes a call over to Cloud CMS to check the permission.  Thus, it's fairly
        expensive to do.  Fortunately, Cloud CMS permission checks everything for you, before it allows the caller
        to interact with data stores or objects.  Thus, most of the checks that you'd probably find yourself wanting
        to perform happen automatically on the server side.
    </p>

    <h2>Bulk Permission Checks</h2>
    <p>
        In the case shown above, we checked a single permission against a data store.  Well, what if wanted to check
        a whole bunch of permissions?  Rather than make lots of HTTP calls, we can send them all over the wire at once
        and have the bulk check and come back in one fell swoop.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        This works much faster than going one-at-a-time.
