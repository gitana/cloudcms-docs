                If true, the data store will check whether the current principal has rights to perform an
                operation against content upon interaction.  If turned off, you'll see some performance
                benefits.  This should only ever be switched off for "published" or general availability
                content and never for authoring-side content.

                If true, then the data store will collect audit records for all service-level operations
                (such as CRUD operations).  This incurs a slight performance penalty but guarantees you
                a record of all interactions with data for changesets, branches and nodes in the data store.
