    <p>
        Associations are a special kind of node which is responsible for defining a relationship between two other
        non-association nodes.  By all accounts, Associations are proper nodes.  You can create custom Types for
        associations, define new attributes and override behaviors.  Associations are indexed and full-text
        searchable.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Associations, on the other hand, do not bear permissions.  They are considered structural elements that provide
        several meanings for the content in a branch:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The "linked" relationships between nodes.  These relationships can be broken by either party without
            validating the integrity of either object.  An example is a "related items" relationship in a web site.
            Suppose Product A points to Product B via a linked relationship.  If Product B is deleted, the association
            is also deleted and no harm is done.
        </li>
        <li>
            The "owned" relationships between nodes.  These relationships imply that one or both ends of the association
            require the other end to exist and be valid in order for the entire structure to be valid.  An example is
            a Book with multiple Chapters, where each Chapter has multiple Pages.  One way to model this is to think
            of a Book as owning its Chapters.  And each Chapter owns its Pages.  If you were to delete a Page, you
            would invalidate the Chapter (since its now missing pages).  And invalidating a Chapter would in turn
            invalidate the entire Book.
        </li>
        <li>
            Any other kind of relationship that you wish to model.  Since associations are nodes, you're free to define
            custom metadata and custom server-side behaviors for your objects.  You might, for example, need to make
            remote calls to a third-party service to determine the validity of the object model.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directionality</h2>
    <p>
        Each Association defines a <code>source</code> and a <code>target</code> node which are related together
        via the association.  Associations also have a <code>directionality</code> field which defines the
        direction of the association.  This field can have one of two values:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>directed</code> - the association points from source to target</li>
        <li><code>undirected</code> - the association points both from source to target and target to source</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        An undirected association gives equal merit to the idea that the association points from source to target
        as from target to source.  This allows for a mutual relationship.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        An example of a mutual (or undirected) relationship is a married couple.  A wife is married to her husband
        and the husband is also married to his wife.  Both are convinced they're in a mutual relationship.
        Except, of course, when he obsesses over football and forgets to the dishes.  Well...
    </p>

    <!-- CONFIGURATION -->
    <h2>Configuration</h2>
    <p>
        Associations are Nodes and so any configuration properties for Nodes also apply to Associations.
        However, there are a few additional system properties that Associations maintain.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        As always, you're free to plug in your own custom properties as you see fit.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The following table presents you the system properties.

    <!-- CREATE -->

    <h2 id="create">Create an Association</h2>
    <p>
        You can create an arbitrary, untyped relationship between two nodes.  If you don't specify the type of
        relationship, Cloud CMS uses the generic but much-esteemed <code>a:linked</code> association type.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Here's an example of a simple, generic association:
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="create1"></div>
    <p>
        Of course, you're far better off if you give your associations a type.  By giving them a type, you add
        some meaning to the association.  You define the type using association type definitions.  See the
        section on Definitions for information on how to do this.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Let's revisit our book example from above.  Suppose we have an association type called
        <code>custom:hasChapter</code>.  We can create an association like this:
        <br/>
        <br/>
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="create2"></div>
    <p>
        What about undirected associations?  It's pretty easy.  Here is our marriage example from above:
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="create3"></div>
    <p>
        Finally, what if you want to create an association to a target node.  This is the same operation but
        looking at from the viewpoint of the target (rather than the source).  You can do that like this:
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="create4"></div>



    <!-- UPDATE -->

    <h2 id="update">Update an Association</h2>
    <p>
        Associations are simply nodes.  We update them in exactly the same way that we update Nodes.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="update1"></div>



    <!-- DELETE -->

    <h2 id="delete">Delete an Association</h2>
    <p>
        You can delete an association just like you delete a node:
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="delete1"></div>
    <p>
        Or you can simple delete an association just as you would delete a node:
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="delete2"></div>




    <!-- READ -->

    <h2 id="read">Read an Association</h2>
    <p>
        You can read an association just like you read a Node.
        For example, you can read the node by its ID or its QName:
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="read1"></div>



    <!-- LIST -->

    <h2 id="list">List Associations</h2>
    <p>
        You can list the associations that connect a specific node.  Associations, from the perspective of a node,
        are considered to be <code>OUTGOING</code> or <code>INCOMING</code>.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Here is an example of retrieving all associations that flow in or out of a node.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="list1"></div>
    <p>
        You can specify the association <code>type</code> and the <code>direction</code> that you're seeking.
        Here is an example that retrieves any <code>INCOMING</code> associations of type "custom:hasChapter".
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="list2"></div>
    <p>
        Finally, you can apply pagination to reduce the amount of traffic over the wire and enhance performance.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="list3"></div>




    <!-- LIST INCOMING ASSOCIATIONS -->

    <h2 id="list-incoming">List Incoming Associations</h2>
    <p>
        If you just want to retrieve a list of the incoming associations, you can use this shortcut:
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="list-incoming1"></div>



    <!-- LIST INCOMING ASSOCIATIONS -->

    <h2 id="list-outgoing">List Outgoing Associations</h2>
    <p>
        If you just want to retrieve a list of the outgoing associations, you can use this shortcut:
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="list-outgoing1"></div>
