    <h1>Authorities</h1>
    <p>
        Every data store and object in Cloud CMS maintains access control lists so that you can finely describe the
        rights of any principal in the system against it.  This lets you finely tune the rights of individual users
        against data stores and objects down to a single permission.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        This access control is authority-based which means that it's applied by granting authorities (or roles) that
        a principal has over an object.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Let's buckle down on the terminology for a moment:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            A <b>Permissioned</b> entity is a data store or object that the permissions service knows how to work with.
            As noted, this includes absolutely everything within Cloud CMS.
        </li>
        <li>
            A <b>Principal</b> is the user or person acting upon a Permissioned.
        </li>
        <li>
            A <b>Permission</b> is a capability that you can grant to a principal.
        </li>
        <li>
            An <b>Authority</b> is a Role that packages together multiple permissions.  When you grant a principal an
            authority over an object or data store, all of the permissions of that authority are in turn granted.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Let's take a look at the list of permissions:
    </p>
    <table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
        <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Authority</th>

        </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>Group Inheritance of Authorities</h2>
    <p>
        Cloud CMS supports group-based inheritance of authorities.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        If you grant an authority to a Domain Group, all principal members of that Domain Group will also be
        granted that authority.  This is the concept of "group inheritance".  It makes it so that you don't have to
        go to every single member of the group, one by one, and grant the authority.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        This is just one of the many benefits of groups.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        A good way to think about this is to imagine a sales team with, say, five people on it.  You might create a
        group called "Sales" and then add all five sales people as members of the team.  You might also have a folder
        called "Sales Documents" which you want only the sales people to be able to collaborate upon.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Simple.  All you have to do is grant the "Sales" group the "collaborator" authority to the folder.  By the
        magic of group inheritance, all of the sales people on the "Sales" team will also be collaborators.
    </p>

    <h2>Container-based Propagation of Authorities</h2>
    <p>
        Cloud CMS supports container-based propagation of authorities.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        This applies most directly in the case of Repositories.  Within a Repository, you can create folders.  Folders
        are a like folders on your desktop.  They are directories inside of which you put your content.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        If you grant a user the "collaborator" authority over a folder, he'll automatically receive "collaborator"
        authorities over the things contained inside that folder.  This is because folders are "containers".  Cloud CMS
        automatically propagates the rights of the user over the container as rights over the children.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Getting more into the details, what actually happens is that folders have associations
        of type <code>a:child</code> with their contained nodes.  This association type has a feature on it called
        <code>f:propagates-authority</code> which indicates that this association should bestow its granted authorities
        to the target of the association.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        You can disable this propagation by disabling the feature on the node.  Or, you can model your own association
        types and take advantage of propagation as you see fit.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The folder scenario provided above works out-of-the-box but you're free to model content as you require.
    </p>

    <h2>Some Terminology</h2>
    <p>
        It's worth taking a moment to point out some terminology with respect to group inheritance and container-based
        propagation.
    </p>
    <table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
        <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Terminology</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>direct</td>
            <td>Describes a grant that was made directly to a Permissioned.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>indirect</td>
            <td>
                Describes a grant that was understood to be made against a Permissioned as a result of group-based inheritance.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>inherited</td>
            <td>
                Describes a grant that is direct but which was created as a result of container-based propagation.
                <br/>
                Inherited grants cannot be revoked directly.  They can only be revoked by revoking the original grant.
            </td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
        Indirect and inherited authority grants will appear as you interrogate the access control set up of objects.
        They are flagged accordingly.  Inherited grants contain references to their origination (i.e. the location of the original direct grant).
    </p>

    <h2>List Authorities</h2>
    <p>
        You can request a list <b>direct</b> authorities that a given principal has against an object or data store.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="list1"></div>


    <h2>Check Authority</h2>
    <p>
        You can check whether a principal has been granted a given authority over a data store or an object by
        making a simple call over to the server to ask.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        This method checks both the <b>direct</b> and <b>indirect</b> authorities.  It is a fully evaluative check and
        is intended to answer the runtime question as to whether a user has a given authority.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        It does not answer the question of whether the user was directly granted the authority over the data store or
        object.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Here is an example that checks whether a user has the "consumer" role over a domain.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="check1"></div>

    <h2>Grant Authority</h2>
    <p>
        You can grant a <b>direct</b> authority to other principals over a data store or object.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="grant1"></div>
    <p>
        Bear in mind that you can only do this if you are authenticated to Cloud CMS as a user who has the
        <code>MODIFY_PERMISSIONS</code> permission against the data store or object.
    </p>

    <h2>Revoke Authority</h2>
    <p>
        You can revoke a <b>direct</b> authority from other principals over a data store or object.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="revoke1"></div>
    <p>
        Bear in mind that you can only do this if you are authenticated to Cloud CMS as a user who has the
        <code>MODIFY_PERMISSIONS</code> permission against the data store or object.
    </p>

    <h2>Revoke All Authorities</h2>
    <p>
        If you want to completely revoke any <b>direct</b> authorities that a user might have been granted to
        an object, there is a shortcut method you can use.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="revokeAll1"></div>
    <p>
        Bear in mind that you can only do this if you are authenticated to Cloud CMS as a user who has the
        <code>MODIFY_PERMISSIONS</code> permission against the data store or object.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        In addition, one must consider that a user might receive the granted authority in multiple ways.  They might
        have been granted it directly.  But they may also belong to a group that has been granted it.  In this case,
        if you revoke the direct authority, the user will still have the grant since they get it from the group.
    </p>

    <h2>Access Control List</h2>
    <p>
        At various times you may want to consult the full access control list (ACL) for a data store or an object.
        The access control list shows exactly which principals have been <b>directly</b> granted which authorities.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        It's worth repeating.  This only shows <b>direct</b> grants.  If you want a fully evaluative list of
        authority grants, see the section below on Authority Grants.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Here is an example that retrieves the access control list for a node in the master branch of a repository.
        It then prints out the ACL to console.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="acl1"></div>

    <h2>Full Authority Grants</h2>
    <p>
        In many applications, when rendering a page, you need to make a front-end decision about what rights one
        or more users has to elements being rendered.  A good example of this is when you need to figure out what
        state to render buttons (i.e. active, disabled, hidden).
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Cloud CMS lets you bulk all of these checks into a single "authority grant" request.  You pass in the
        users that you're interested in and Cloud CMS hands back a list of every authority granted for those users.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        This method also provides a fully evaluative list of all authorities for the set of users.  This includes
        <b>direct</b> and <b>indirect</b> authority grants.  And, as you would expect, among the <b>direct</b>
        authority grants are any inherited grants from container-based propagation.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Here is an example that displays the list of fully evaluative authority grants for a repository.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="full1"></div>
