    <p>
        All of the content in your branch is stored as Nodes.  Nodes are vertexes in an arbitrarily structured
        graph.  You store your content in Nodes and you relate Nodes to one another using Associations.
        Associations are a special kind of Node that points from one non-association Node to another.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Nodes are also typed.  Every node you create takes on a type.  Types are identified by their QName which
        is consists of a <code>prefix</code> and <code>local name</code>.  You don't have to provide types for your
        Nodes if you don't want to.  If nothing is provided, the default node type of <code>n:node</code> is used.
    </p>

    <!-- CONFIGURATION -->
    <h2>Configuration</h2>
    <p>
        The node configuration contains system and custom properties.  You can write your own properties
        as you see fit.  However, system properties should be left alone as they are read-only.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The following table presents you the system properties.
    </p>
    <h4>Node Properties</h4>
    <table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
        <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Property</th>
            <th>Type</th>
            <th>Default</th>
            <th nowrap>Read-Only</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>        </thead>

        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>_features</td>
            <td>object</td>
            <td></td>
            <td>Read-Only</td>
            <td>
                This object contains all of the configuration for features which have been applied to this node
                instance.  Feature configurations are keyed by feature QName.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>_qname</td>
            <td>text</td>
            <td></td>
            <td>Read-Only</td>
            <td>
                The QName for this node instance.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>_type</td>
            <td>text</td>
            <td></td>
            <td>Read-Only</td>
            <td>
                The QName for the type of this node.
            </td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
        Any system properties that are shown to be Read-Only are not modifiable on calls to <code>create()</code> or <code>update()</code>.
        Anything else is fair game.
    </p>

    <!-- CREATE -->

    <h2 id="create">Create a Node</h2>
    <p>
        You can create as many nodes in a branch as you like.  By default, nodes are empty JSON documents.  They
        are also disconnected from any other nodes.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Creating a node is as simple as:
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="create1"></div>
    <p>
        The example above creates an empty node.  We can also pass in JSON that we want to store onto the node.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Here is an example where we create an "album" node.  We store the title of the album, the artist who
        recorded it and the year it was released.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="create2"></div>



    <!-- UPDATE -->

    <h2 id="update">Update a Node</h2>
    <p>
        You can update any of the non-system properties of a node.  You can also add your own custom properties.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="update1"></div>



    <!-- DELETE -->

    <h2 id="delete">Delete a Node</h2>
    <p>
        When you delete a node, the node is marked as deleted on the tip changeset.  Effectively, it is deleted,
        however repositories allow you to restore (or rewind) in case you make a mistake.  Your previous edits and
        versions of the node are preserved.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Here is an example of a node deletion:
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="delete1"></div>




    <!-- READ -->

    <h2 id="read">Read a Node</h2>
    <p>
        You can read a node by its ID or its QName.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="read1"></div>



    <!-- SEARCH -->

    <h2 id="list">Search for Nodes</h2>
    <p>
        By default, all of nodes you put into a Cloud CMS branch are indexed for full-text search.  The JSON content
        of your node is indexed as well as any attachments.  If you upload a PDF document, for example, Cloud CMS will
        extract any tokens from the PDF document and make those searchable.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Thus, you have automatic full-text search for everything you drop into a Cloud CMS repository.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Here is an example of a simple full text search:
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="search1"></div>
    <p>
        As you can imagine, the set of results can be pretty large.  You can utilize pagination to reduce the traffic
        over the wire and enhance performance.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="search2"></div>
    <p>
        Cloud CMS utilizes <a target="_blank" href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/">Elastic Search</a> for full-text
        search and indexing.  As such, you can write much more powerful full-text search queries against the JSON
        of your documents.  The full JSON object is indexed.  Thus, you can utilize the
        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/query-dsl/">Elastic Search Query DSL</a>
        to define more advanced queries.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Here is an example that uses the Elastic Search Query DSL and also applies some pagination:
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="search3"></div>



    <!-- QUERY -->

    <h2 id="query">Query for Nodes</h2>
    <p>
        You can run custom queries against your nodes to find exactly what you're looking for.
        Here is a query that looks for nodes whose field <code>artist</code> is <code>Mary Lou Lord</code>.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="query1"></div>
    <p>
        Here is that same query followed by an iteration over the result map.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="query2"></div>
    <p>
        Cloud CMS utilizes the MongoDB query syntax under the hood.  As such, you can really go to town.
        You're able to express queries with some pretty rich complexity.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Here is a query that finds all albums created between the years 2002 and 2006.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="query3"></div>
