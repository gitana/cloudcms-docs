    <p>
        A branch is a workspace for your content.  Each repository supports one or more branches.  You basically
        create all of your content items in a branch.  This includes articles, blog posts, new items, documents,
        Office files, PDFs, etc.  You name it.  They go into a branch.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        You can have as many branches as you want.  Each branch is a completely isolated workspace.  Thus, you can
        create your own branch for your own projects.  You can work on those projects and when you're happy with it,
        you can share it with the rest of the team.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Or, you can create a branch and invite a bunch of people to work with you.  They're your own workspaces.
        You can play with them however you want.
    </p>
    <h2>Changesets and Branches</h2>
    <p>
        You can think of a branch in the same way as you might think of the tree of a branch.  Like that old Maple
        tree in the backyard when you were a kid.  Remember that tree?  You used to climb it.  Then one day, you
        fell out of it and now, pretty much, that's all you hear about when you go home for family reunions.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Anyway, yeah, so a branch is like a tree branch.  Each tree branch stems from a previous branch.  And branches
        are made up of changesets.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        A changeset is a bit like a layer from a transparency.  When you write content into a branch, it goes onto
        a new changeset.  Every time you make a change, like when you update something or delete something, it also
        goes onto a new changeset.  And so, in this way, branches grow in length.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Branches also maintain a "tip" view which is the sum total of all changes, creates, updates and deletes that
        you make while working with the branch.  Thus, at all times, the full "changeset history" of everything
        you've done is maintained but so is a "tip" view that gives you a real-time view of what is effectively a
        top-most version of all your content.
    </p>

    <!-- CONFIGURATION -->
    <h2>Configuration</h2>
    <p>
        The branch configuration contains system and custom properties.  You can write your own properties
        onto this configuration document if you wish.  You might use those properties to query and retrieve the
        branch at a later time.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Some system properties are read-only and others are writable.  You can adjust the writable properties
        to modify the behavior and characteristics of the branch.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The following table presents you the system properties.
    </p>

        </tbody>

    <p>
        Any system properties that are shown to be Read-Only are not modifiable on calls to <code>create()</code> or <code>update()</code>.
        Anything else is fair game.
    </p>




    <!-- CREATE -->

    <h2 id="create">Create a Branch</h2>
    <p>
        You can create as many new branches as you'd like.  To create a branch, you simply need to specify the root
        changeset for the new branch.  You can create a branch from any existing changeset.  The root changeset
        identifies the point at which the new branch "branches off" from the old branch.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="create1"></div>
    <p>
        Here is an example where we create a branch that "branches off" from the master branch.
    </p>



    <!-- UPDATE -->

    <h2 id="update">Update a Branch</h2>
    <p>
        You can update any of the non-system properties of a branch.  You can also add your own custom properties.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="update1"></div>



    <!-- DELETE -->

    <h2 id="delete">Delete a Branch</h2>
    <p>
        Branch deletion at present is not supported.  This will be coming in the future.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        However, in its place, you can accomplish must of the same desired effect by marking a branch as "frozen".
        Frozen branches are effectively disabled.
    </p>

    <h2 id="freeze">Freeze a Branch</h2>
    <p>
        You can mark a branch as frozen to indicate that no further work should occur on the branch.  A frozen branch
        cannot be updated, written to, or deleted from.  New changesets cannot be added to the frozen branch.
        Effectively, the branch is no longer permitted to grow in size.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        In addition, frozen branches cannot be forked.  In other words, you cannot stem a new branch from a
        frozen branch.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Here is an example of freezing a branch:
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="freeze1"></div>
    <p>
        You are also able to unfreeze branches at any time which restores them to their normal operational state.
    </p>

    <h2 id="readonly">Mark a branch as read-only</h2>
    <p>
        Alternatively, you may simple want to mark a branch as read-only.  A read-only branch can still be utilized
        but not create, update or deletion operations may be performed against it.  Read-only branches can be
        forked.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Here is an example marking a branch as read-only:
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="readonly1"></div>




    <!-- READ -->

    <h2 id="read">Read a Branch</h2>
    <p>
        You can read a branch by its ID.
        <br/>
        As a special case, you can retrieve the master branch by using the text <code>master</code>.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="read1"></div>



    <!-- LIST -->

    <h2 id="list">List Branches</h2>
    <p>
        You can retrieve a list of branches for your repository quite easily.
        The following code hands back the full list.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="list1"></div>
    <p>
        You can then iterate over the list to pick at what you'd like.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="list2"></div>
    <p>
        Retrieving the full list is potentially an expensive operation, depending how many branches you have.
        The more your retrieve, the more data goes over the wire and so forth.  Thus, you might wish to
        <i>paginate</i> your call and retrieve a subset of the total list at a time.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Here is an example that retrieves in pages of size 10.
        It starts on the second page (by skipping to starting index 20).
        It also sorts by the <code>title</code> field in a descending sequence.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="list3"></div>
    <p>
        You don't have to have all of the pagination parameters (<code>limit</code>, <code>skip</code> and <code>sorting</code>).
        You might only want to include one or two.  It's up to you.
    </p>



    <!-- QUERY -->

    <h2 id="query">Query Branches</h2>
    <p>
        You can run custom queries against your branches to find exactly what you're looking for.
        Here is a query that looks for branches whose field <code>department</code> is <code>"sales"</code>.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="query1"></div>
    <p>
        Here is that same query followed by an iteration over the result map.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="query2"></div>
    <p>
        Cloud CMS utilizes the MongoDB query syntax under the hood.  As such, you can really go to town.
        You're able to express queries with some pretty rich complexity.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Here is a query that finds all branches created after July 4, 2012.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="query3"></div>
    <p>
        Finally, you can mix queries with pagination to reduce data over the wire and speed up performance.
        Here is that same query with some pagination thrown in.  We limit to pages of size 10 and sort by <code>title</code>.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="query4"></div>



    <!-- MOUNTS -->

    <h2 id="mounts">List Mount Nodes</h2>
    <p>
        You can retrieve a list of mount nodes for a given branch.  Mount nodes are starting points for
        container-based navigation of the node hierarchy.  You can designate specific container nodes as "mount points"
        by associating them to the "root node" (with QName <code>r:root</code>) via an association type of
        <code>a:has_mount</code>.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Here is a quick way to find them:
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="mount-list1"></div>
