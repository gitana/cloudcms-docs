    <h1>Pagination</h1>
    <p>
        Pagination allows you to control the result set that comes back from Cloud CMS for any operations that produce
        a list of items.  It is called pagination because it gives you a way to organize your record set into pages
        and then get those pages back, one at a time.
    </p>
    <p>
        Pagination gives you a way to adjust the result set before it is sent over the wire (and back to you)
        so that you can have smaller "paged" payloads.  Pagination is useful because, most of the time, unless
        the result set is very small, you're not going to be interested in dealing with all of the items at once.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, with pagination, you can do things like query for all of the users in a domain.  You might be
        interested in presenting them on the screen.  Let's imagine there are 10,000 users.  Well, chances are you
        probably don't want to show 10,000 users on the screen all at once.  Instead, maybe you'd like to only show
        50 at a time.  Pagination lets you tell Cloud CMS to hand back 50 starting at index 0.  Or jump ahead to index
        9017 and give back the next 50 (i.e. users 9017 through 9066).  That way, you're only getting 50 users at a
        time.  However, you can get back a different 50 each time, as you web application user clicks forward and back.
    </p>
    <p>
        Specifically, pagination lets you adjust two important properties:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>skip</b> - how many records you'd like to skip ahead in the total result set before handing back.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>limit</b> - how many records in total you'd like to have sent over the wire.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Sorting</h2>
    <p>
        Pagination also lets you define how the record set should be sorted before it is handed back.  The sorting
        is taken into account during query or lookup time so that the actual cursor into the underlying database is
        used to optimize performance.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can sort on zero or more fields.  For each field, you can choose to sort in ascending (1) or descending (-1)
        order.  You specify this by passing a JSON object that defines this for any and all fields.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, the following could be used to sort users first by their name and second by a nested custom
        property:
    </p>
    <div class="spacer">
        <code>{ "name": 1, "company.name": -1 }</code>
    </div>
    <h2>REST API</h2>
    <p>
        For methods in the REST API that produce lists of items, you can pass pagination information via request
        parameters.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, the following would hand back a list of 10 principals from a domain starting at index 5 in the
        result set.  There may 1,000 users overall, but you'd only get back 10 (numbers 5 through 14).
    </p>
    <div class="spacer">
    <code >http://api.cloudcms.com/domains/domainId/principals?skip=5&limit=10</code>
    </div>
    <p>
        We can also pass sorting information along:
    </p>
    <div class="spacer">
    <code>http://api.cloudcms.com/domains/domainId/principals?skip=5&limit=10&sort={"name":1,"company.name":-1}</code>
    </div>
    <h2>Driver methods</h2>
    <p>
        You can also pass pagination information via driver methods.  Most drivers support pagination as an optional
        argument into methods that produce lists of objects.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here we retrieve the same list of 10 users from a domain starting from index 5.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="pagination1"></div>
    <p>
        Here we retrieve the same list but we sort by <code>name</code> and <code>company.name</code>:
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="pagination2"></div>
    <p>
        We can also perform custom queries and paginate the results:
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="pagination3"></div>
