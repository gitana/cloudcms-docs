    <p>
        A Domain Group is a principal that collects together zero or more Domain Principals into a common organizational
        unit (such as a department or a team).  Domain Groups can collect together both users and other groups.  And since
        groups may contain other groups, Domain Groups are primary components of the membership hierarchy.  They may
        describe either branches or leaves of the hierarchy tree.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The Cloud CMS authority and permission systems utilize the membership hierarchy to determine the full set of
        authorities that a user has been granted against an object or data store.  If a group is granted an authority,
        then the members of that group inherit the grants.  This inheritance propagates down the chain until
        all of the child nodes are affected.
    </p>


    <!-- CONFIGURATION -->
    <h2>Configuration</h2>
    <p>
        Domain Groups maintain a configuration that you can adjust or consult as you create, update and query for them.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The following table presents you the configuration properties.
    </p>
    <table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
        <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Property</th>
            <th>Type</th>
            <th>Default</th>
            <th nowrap>Read-Only</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>name</td>
            <td>text</td>
            <td></td>
            <td></td>
            <td>
                The name (i.e. the user id or account name) for the principal.  This can be any text that you
                like.  However, it must be unique across all users in the domain.  For example, you cannot have two
                users in the domain with the name "joe".
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>type</td>
            <td>text</td>
            <td></td>
            <td>Read-Only</td>
            <td>
                The type of principal - either <code>USER</code> or <code>GROUP</code>.
                This value is auto-populated upon creation.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>authorities</td>
            <td>array</td>
            <td>[]</td>
            <td></td>
            <td>
                An array of text describing the authorities that this user should be granted.  This is customizable
                for your own use and describes server-scoped authorities.  Cloud CMS does not use this array for
                any of its internal authority calculations against objects or data stores.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                Cloud CMS makes this available for use with such frameworks as Spring Security or Ruby on Rails
                where the list of authorities can be consulted to determine rights against specific controllers
                or services at invocation time.

    <h2 id="create">Create a Domain Group</h2>
    <p>
        You create a Domain Group by passing in a configuration object that contains, at minimum, the
        <code>name</code> of the group being created.  The <code>name</code> of the group must be unique across all
        principals in the domain.  You cannot have two groups with the same <code>name</code> in the same domain.
        Similarly, you cannot have a user and a group with the same <code>name</code> in the same domain.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Here is how you create a Domain Group:
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="create1"></div>
    <p>
        You can provide additional properties and also custom properties at the point of creation.
        Here is an example of you'd do that:
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="create2"></div>




    <h2 id="update">Update a Domain Group</h2>
    <p>
        To update, all you have to do is make changes to your Domain Group and fire away.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="update1"></div>
    <p>
        You can update any property you'd like from the domain group except for the <code>type</code>.  You cannot
        switch a group into a user or vice-versa.  While both Domain Groups and Domain Users are Domain Principals,
        they're not interchangeable.
    </p>




    <h2 id="delete">Delete a Domain Group</h2>
    <p>
        You can delete a Domain Group at any time provided that the group does not have any members.  An error
        will be raised if you attempt to delete a group that has members.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Here is an example of group deletion:
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="delete1"></div>



    <h2 id="read">Read a Domain Group</h2>
    <p>
        You can read a Domain Group by its <code>_doc</code> ID field.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="read1"></div>




    <h2 id="list">List Domain Groups</h2>
    <p>
        You can retrieve a list of Domain Groups for your domain quite easily.
        The following code hands back the full list.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="list1"></div>
    <p>
        You can then iterate over the list to pick at what you'd like.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="list2"></div>
    <p>
        Retrieving the full list is potentially an expensive operation, depending how many items you have.
        The more your retrieve, the more data goes over the wire and so forth.  Thus, you might wish to
        <i>paginate</i> your call and retrieve a subset of the total list at a time.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Here is an example that retrieves in pages of size 10.
        It starts on the second page (by skipping to starting index 20).
        It also sorts by the <code>title</code> field in a descending sequence.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="list3"></div>
    <p>
        You don't have to have all of the pagination parameters (<code>limit</code>, <code>skip</code> and <code>sorting</code>).
        You might only want to include one or two.  It's up to you.
    </p>




    <h2 id="query">Query Domain Groups</h2>
    <p>
        You can run custom queries against your Domain Groups to find exactly what you're looking for.
        Here is a query that looks for Domain Users which are disabled.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="query1"></div>
    <p>
        Here is that same query followed by an iteration over the result map.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="query2"></div>
    <p>
        Finally, you can mix queries with pagination to reduce data over the wire and speed up performance.
        Here is that same query with some pagination thrown in.
        We limit to pages of size 10 and sort by <code>title</code>.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="query3"></div>




    <h2 id="listmembers">List Members of a Group</h2>
    <p>
        You can retrieve a list of the members of a group:
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="listmembers1"></div>
    <p>
        You can also elect to filter to retrieve only the members of type <code>USER</code> or <code>GROUP</code>.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="listmembers2"></div>
    <p>
        When you retrieve membership for a group, you can either retrieve direct membership (just those members
        who are direct first-level members of the group) or you can retrieve indirect membership.  Indirect
        memberships include principals who belong to intermediary groups which may belong to your group, at any
        depth in the hierarchy.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="listmembers3"></div>
    <p>
        You can also take advantage of pagination on retrieval.  This reduces the payload of the requests and amount
        of data over the wire.  Pagination serves to make your applications more efficient.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="listmembers4"></div>
    <p>
        You may wish to use the following convenience functions when working with users or groups.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="listmembers5"></div>
    <p>
        You can also list membership from the domain directly:
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="listmembers6"></div>





    <h2 id="addmember">Add Member to Group</h2>
    <p>
        You can add a member to a group:
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="addmember1"></div>
    <p>
        You can also do this from the domain:
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="addmember2"></div>

    <h2 id="removemember">Remove Member from Group</h2>
    <p>
        Or you can remove a member from a group:
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="removemember1"></div>
    <p>
        You can also do this from the domain:
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="removemember2"></div>
