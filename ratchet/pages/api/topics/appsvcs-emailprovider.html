    <h1>Email Provider</h1>
    <p>
        The public application services often need to send emails as part of their respective flows.  To do this, a
        public email provider must be configured for the application.  This is email provider that the public services
        will use when dispatching emails as part of a public flow.
    </p>
    <p>
        On this page, we cover a few convenience methods that are available to test your email provider as well as
        send emails straight away.  This page assumes that you are already familiar with email providers.  If you'd
        like to read more about email providers, please read up on
        <a href="#/api/emailprovider/javascript">Email Providers</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        To work with these methods, you first need to have an
        <a href="#/api/application/javascript">Application</a> data store instantiated that will be used to store
        data for your mobile/web application.  You can instantiate this through the Cloud CMS console or you can do
        so programmatically.  Once you've done so, you will need to configure the application instance to have the
        following property:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>public.emailProviderId</code> - The ID of one of your platform's email providers that should be used to send emails.
    </ul>
    <h2>Sample configuration</h2>
    The following JSON can be appended into your Application JSON (which you can edit within the Cloud CMS console).  Or you can
    edit your application and enter these values via a form.
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="example1" fileext=".json"></div>

        Below we cover step-by-step how to use the API methods to complete a "forgot username" flow.

    </p>
    <h3>Test your Email Provider</h3>
    <p>
        Once you've created your email provider and configured it with connectivity information to your email server, you will
        want to test to ensure that it is properly set up.  Cloud CMS can perform a test connection to your email server and
        send a test email.  If you receive this email, then you know your email provider is working.
    </p>
    <p>
        To test your email provider, you make a call to Cloud CMS:
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <code>POST /pub/applications/{applicationId}/emailprovider/test?from={from}&to={to}</code>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        You need to specify the ID of your Application instance (<code>applicationId</code>) in the path to the method.
        You also need to provide the email address that the email will come (<code>from</code>)
        as well as specify the recipient that the email will be sent (<code>to</code>).
    </p>
    <p>
        Here is an example that uses jQuery:
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="test1" fileext=".js"></div>
    <p>
        If the email provider is configured correctly, the recipient will receive a test email.  If there is some kind
        of problem, you will receive back an error code with some JSON messages that should help you to figure things out.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you don't get an error and you also don't get an email, then you should check with your email server administrator.
        This often means that the connectivity to the email server is fine but that something on the email server end prevented
        the email from being sent.  For example, the email server administrator may have rules configured within their server
        that quarantined your email (based on a non-trusted IP, spam filter, or a scan of the contents of your email).
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, you should check your own "spam" or "junk" folders within your email client to ensure that the email
        wasn't received and then moved based on a filter.  If this is the case, you should work with your email server
        administrator to determine how their spam rules work and optimize your email accordingly.
    </p>
    <h3>Send an Email</h3>
    <p>
        At times, you will want to send an ad-hoc email that isn't part of a flow.  The Cloud CMS public application
        services let you send either a pre-saved email or create a new email and send it all at once.
    </p>
    <p>
        To first create an email, you should follow the instructions provided on our section on
        <a href="#/api/email/javascript">Working with Emails</a>.  Emails are saved objects.  You can create them, edit them,
        permission them and collaborate on their authorship.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you have an email, you can send it like this:
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <code>POST /pub/applications/{applicationId}/emailprovider/send?id={emailId}</code>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The email will be sent using the public email provider.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you want to create and send an email all at once, you can do so by posting the JSON payload for the email
        definition like this:
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>POST /pub/applications/{applicationId}/emailprovider/send</code>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The email will be created and then sent right away using the public email provider.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here is an example of using some straightforward jQuery to create and send an email:
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="send1" fileext=".js"></div>
    <p>
        In either case, be sure to test your email provider ahead of time to ensure that you have it properly configured.
    </p>
