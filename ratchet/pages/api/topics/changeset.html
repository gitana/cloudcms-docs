    <p>
        Cloud CMS automatically creates and maintains the state of the individual changesets that compose
        your branches as you work with content.  A changeset is like a transparency for a visual projector.
        When you write content into a branch (via a create, update or delete), the content is written onto a
        changeset (or transparency).  That way, the things you worked on before are never affected.  They new updates
        are just overlaid on top.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        In this sense, a branch can be thought of as a stack of changesets.  There is a root changeset (where the
        branch starts) and a tip changeset (where the branch ends).  Everything in-between constitutes the
        changeset history of the branch.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        This portion of the API therefore is largely for advanced users.  The Cloud CMS API lets you dig in
        and poke around at the changeset history of branches to do things like discover what changes were introduced
        on which changeset in the branch.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        You probably don't need to do this unless you're building some really cool authoring or curation tools.
        Cloud CMS provides applications out-of-the-box that hopefully let you do most of the heavy lifting
        from an authoring viewpoint.  So most of these APIs are cool but probably not very commonly used.
    </p>
    <h2>Changeset IDs</h2>
    <p>
        Most of the <code>_doc</code> identifiers for objects inside of Cloud CMS are GUIDs (globally unique IDs).
        Changesets are a bit different.  Changeset IDs are stored in the <code>_doc</code> field but they have
        a special structure which looks like this:
    </p>
    <p align="center">
        <code>{revision}:{guid}</code>
    </p>
    <p>
        As you write nodes into your branch, new changesets are layered into the branch.  One at a time.  Each
        new changeset has an incremented revision and a brand new GUID.  Thus, the revision number always goes up
        one integer at a time.
        The changeset ID ends up looking something like this: <code>452:4b5b685c980c10f98beb</code>
    </p>
    <h2>Transactions</h2>
    <p>
        Changesets play an important role in transaction handling for writes onto branches.  When a transaction begins,
        a new changeset is created.  All of the writes (creates, updates and deletes) which occur as part of the
        transaction are committed to the database and flagged with the changeset.  Only once all the writes have
        succeeded is the changeset flipped to an 'active' state.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        If a transaction fails, the changeset is not flipped to an 'active' state.  Instead, the transaction rolls
        back and the database state is cleaned up.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Only one changeset in a branch can be written to at a time.  Thus, if a transaction is started and another
        thread running in your application attempts to write to the branch, it will be blocked and forced to wait
        until the first thread completes.
    </p>

    <!-- CONFIGURATION -->
    <h2>Configuration</h2>
    <p>
        The changeset configuration contains system and custom properties.  You can write your own properties
        onto this configuration document if you wish.  However, as noted above, this should be exceedingly rare.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Some system properties are read-only and others are writable.  You can adjust the writable properties
        to modify the behavior and characteristics of the branch.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The following table presents you the system properties.
    </p>

    <h4>Branch Properties</h4>
    <table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
        <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Property</th>

            <td>
                Indicates whether the changeset has been successfully "committed" to the branch.
                See the section on transations above.
            </td>

            <td>Read-Only</td>
            <td>
                In the case of a merge, this is an text array that contains the IDs of any parent changesets which
                were merged together underneath this changeset.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>branch</td>
            <td>text</td>
            <td></td>
            <td>Read-Only</td>
            <td>
                The ID of the branch that this changeset sits within.
            </td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
        Any system properties that are shown to be Read-Only are not modifiable on calls to <code>create()</code> or <code>update()</code>.
        Anything else is fair game.
    </p>


    <!-- READ -->

    <h2 id="read">Read a Changeset</h2>
    <p>
        If you have the ID of a changeset, you can retrieve the individual changeset like this:
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="read1"></div>

    <!-- LIST CHANGESET PARENTS -->

    <h2 id="list-parents">Retrieve Changeset Parents</h2>
    <p>
        Every changeset has at least one parent changeset.  The parent changeset is the previous changeset in the
        sequence that composes the branch.  The only exception is the <code>0:root</code> changeset which is the first
        changeset installed for any new repository.  The <code>0:root</code> changeset does not have a parent.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        If a changeset is the changeset that "joins" two or more branches, then it may have multiple changeset
        parents.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Here is an example that retrieves the parents of a changeset:
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="list-parents1"></div>

    <!-- LIST CHANGESET PARENTS -->

    <h2 id="list-children">Retrieve Changeset Children</h2>
    <p>
        Every changeset has at least one child.  The child is the next changeset in the sequence that
        composes the branch.  The only exception is the "tip" changeset of the branch.  The "tip" is the most
        recent changeset applied to the branch.  It does not have children.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        If a new branch has been forked from the current branch, then the changeset sitting at the point of the
        fork may have multiple children.  One child may be the next changeset in the current branch.  And the other
        child may be the first changeset in the new branch.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Here is an example that retrieves the children of a changeset:
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="list-children1"></div>

    <!-- LIST -->

    <h2 id="create">List Changesets</h2>
    <p>
        You can retrieve a manual list of all of the changesets in the repository.  This call is potentially very
        expensive.  For performance, it is recommended instead to query with pagination.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Here is an example that lists changesets and logs to console:
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="list1"></div>

    <!-- QUERY -->

    <h2 id="query">Query Changesets</h2>
    <p>
        You can run custom queries against your changesets to find exactly what you're looking for.
        Here is a query that looks for changesets that sit in a specific branch.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="query1"></div>
    <p>
        And here is an example that paginates instead of retrieving everything all at once:
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="query2"></div>
