    <h1>Transfer</h1>
    <p>
        Cloud CMS supports transfer (import and export) for all data stores and objects.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Transfer allows you to export your data into Archives.  An Archive is a ZIP file which contains a
        manifest file that fully describes the contents of the ZIP.  Archives are automatically stored within
        Vaults.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Transfer lets you import existing archives into new data stores.  This lets you quickly restore the state of
        previous projects or reuse previous projects within new endeavors.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        You can download archives at any time for offline storage and backup.

    <h2>Export an Archive</h2>
    <p>
        To export an archive, all you need to do is provide the target vault and the archive identification properties.
        These archive identification properties are <code>groupId</code>, <code>artifactId</code> and <code>versionId</code>.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Here is an example where we perform a full export of a domain.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="export1"></div>
    <p>
        By default, the export runs as a SYNCHRONOUS job.  If you want to run the job in the background, you can do
        that as well.  Take a look:
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="export2"></div>
    <p>
        Here is an example of some code that exports synchronously and then grabs the archive from the vault.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="export3"></div>

    <h2>Export Configuration</h2>
    <p>
        You can pass in export configuration settings to tweak and control the export process.  The full set of
        options is provided here:

    <h2>Export Job</h2>
    <p>
        An export produces an export job that either runs on a SYNCHRONOUS or ASYNCHRONOUS schedule.  If it runs
        synchronously, then the export will complete before control is handed back to your code.  If it runs
        asynchronously, then you will have wait for the job to complete.  Meanwhile, you're free to do other things.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The Export Job contains a few properties which are interesting:

    <h2>Import an Archive</h2>
    <p>
        You can import any archive from any vault that you have access to.  An archive can either be imported into
        an existing object or it can be imported into a container.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            When importing into an existing object, you can specify whether you want to <b>overwrite</b>.
            If you elect to overwrite, the original object will be destroyed before it is imported again.
            If you do not overwrite, the new object will be merged with the old.
        </li>
        <li>
            When imported into a container, you can specify whether you want to <b>preserve IDs</b>.
            If you elect to preserve IDs, the imports will keep their IDs and write into the container.
            If collisions then occur, the <b>overwrite</b> flag determines whether the colliding objects are
            overwritten or merged.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Other the other hand, if you set do not elect to preserve IDs, the imports will take on new IDs and
            you will essentially create brand new copies.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Here is an example of a simple import:
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="import1"></div>
    <p>
        By default, the import runs as a SYNCHRONOUS job.  If you want to run the job in the background, you can do
        that as well.  Let's lay it down:
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="import2"></div>
    <p>
        Once the job completes, the properties of the job can be used to find out what was imported.
        Here is an example where we import a domain and then look to the job to tell us what was created.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="export3"></div>
