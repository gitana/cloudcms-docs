    <p>
        An Email Provider defines the connectivity to a mail server that you would like your application to interact with
        as it sends and receives emails.  A mail server might be a mail server that you run on-premise or it might be a
        cloud-hosted offering (such as through Google Mail, GoDaddy or Hotmail).
        <br/>
        <br/>
        In this document, we'll assume Google Mail as a mail server and offer configuration samples for it.  You can tweak
        these for your own mail server.  Or, if you need assistance, simply let us know and we can help you tweak and
        configure for your environment.
    </p>

    <!-- CONFIGURATION -->
    <h2>Configuration</h2>
    <p>
        Email Providers maintain a configuration that you can adjust or consult as you create, update and query for them.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The following table presents you the configuration properties.
    </p>

    <h2 id="create">Create an Email Provider</h2>
    <p>
        You can create as many email providers as you'd like.  You will need to reference these email providers when
        you choose to send or receive email.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Here's a simple example where we create an email provider:
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="create1"></div>
    <p>
        Here's a full example for Google Mail:
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="create2"></div>

    <h2 id="update">Update an Email Provider</h2>
    <p>
        To update, all you have to do is make changes to your Email Provider and fire away.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="update1"></div>

    <h2 id="delete">Delete an Email Provider</h2>
    <p>
        It doesn't get much simpler than this:
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="delete1"></div>

    <h2 id="read">Read an Email Provider</h2>
    <p>
        You can read a Email Provider by its <code>_doc</code> ID field.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="read1"></div>

    <h2 id="list">List Email Providers</h2>
    <p>
        You can retrieve a list of Email Providers for your platform quite easily.
        The following code hands back the full list.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="list1"></div>
    <p>
        You can then iterate over the list to pick at what you'd like.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="list2"></div>
    <p>
        Retrieving the full list is potentially an expensive operation, depending how many items you have.
        The more your retrieve, the more data goes over the wire and so forth.  Thus, you might wish to
        <i>paginate</i> your call and retrieve a subset of the total list at a time.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Here is an example that retrieves in pages of size 10.
        It starts on the second page (by skipping to starting index 20).
        It also sorts by the <code>title</code> field in a descending sequence.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="list3"></div>
    <p>
        You don't have to have all of the pagination parameters (<code>limit</code>, <code>skip</code> and <code>sorting</code>).
        You might only want to include one or two.  It's up to you.
    </p>

    <h2 id="query">Query Email Providers</h2>
    <p>
        You can run custom queries against your Email Providers to find exactly what you're looking for.
        Here is a query that looks for Email Providers that point to the host <code>smtp.gmail.com</code>.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="query1"></div>
    <p>
        Here is that same query followed by an iteration over the result map.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="query2"></div>
    <p>
        Finally, you can mix queries with pagination to reduce data over the wire and speed up performance.
        Here is that same query with some pagination thrown in.
        We limit to pages of size 10 and sort by <code>title</code>.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="query3"></div>
