    <h1>Application Services</h1>
    <p>
        Cloud CMS provides a special set of application services methods that provide convenicen functions for your
        front-end mobile or web applications to accomplish things like user registration, password resets and more.
        Technically speaking, everything that you can do with these convenience functions can be done using the
        Cloud CMS API in other ways, however doing so is often multi-step and involves lots of interactions.
        The convenience methods make this easier by letting you pre-wire things on the back-end so that your front-end
        applications can simply fire into a single method.
    </p>
    <p>
        In most cases, pre-wiring your applications services involves making changes to the Application instance
        that is backing your mobile application.  An Application Instance is a data store that provides services
        for things like user registration and also stores configuration settings for your web/mobile application.
