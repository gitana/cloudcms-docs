    <p>
        Cloud CMS provides simple email-based registration for users of your applications or your platform.  You can
        use this registration flow to suit the needs of registrations for your mobile, web or touch-based applications
        as well as clients who wish to sign up to be sub-tenants of your cloud-based platform.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The minimum registration flow looks like this:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            The application collects the user's email
        </li>
        <li>
            The application creates an Registration object.  It stores the <code>emailProviderId</code> of the email
            provider that the registration process will use to dispatch emails.  It also fills in the <code>email</code>
            configurations that define the <code>confirmation</code> and <code>welcome</code> emails.
        </li>
        <li>
            The application plugs in the user's details onto the Registration object.
            It stores the <code>userName</code> and <code>userDomainId</code> to identify which domain
            the final user should be created on.
        </li>
        <li>
            The registration process sends a confirmation email to the end user.
        </li>
        <li>
            The user receives the email and clicks on the link to confirm their identity and intention of registering.
        </li>
        <li>
            The application collects any additional information and sets it onto the Registration object.
        </li>
        <li>
            The registration process confirms the registration.  A user account is created on the target domain.
            A welcome email is sent to the end user.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        The registration flow can also be used to register new sub-tenants for your platform.  To do so, you must
        provide the <code>tenantRegistrarId</code> where the tenant should be created and also the
        <code>tenantPlanKey</code> that identifies the plan the tenant should be given.  The plan must exist in the
        same registrar as the newly created tenant.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        If your plan requires integrated billing, the registrar must be configured to support integrated billing.
        You then need to identify a payment method that the new tenant should use.  You can do this by explicitly
        setting <code>paymentMethodId</code> or by passing in a payment method configuration upon confirmation.
        In the latter case, a new payment method object will be validated and created by the billing provider
        upon creation of the tenant.
    </p>

    <!-- CONFIGURATION -->
    <h2>Configuration</h2>
    <p>
        Emails maintain a configuration that you can adjust or consult as you create, update and query for them.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The following table presents you the configuration properties.

    <h2 id="create">Create a Registration</h2>
    <p>
        You can create as many registrations as you'd like.
        Here's an example:

    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="create1"></div>

    <h2 id="update">Update a Registration</h2>
    <p>
        You can update properties on a registration:
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="update1"></div>

    <h2 id="delete">Delete a Registration</h2>
    <p>
        You can delete registrations just as you would any other object.  However, if a registration has already been
        sent, deleting it will not cause any emails to be unsent (that much should be obvious).
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="delete1"></div>
    <p>
        In addition, if an email is sitting in someone's email inbox with a link to complete the next step in a
        registration flow, the URL may cease to work and the link may break.  Consider setting the registration as
        inactive instead.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="inactive1"></div>

    <h2 id="read">Read a Registration</h2>
    <p>
        You can read a Registration by its <code>_doc</code> ID field.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="read1"></div>

    <h2 id="list">List Registrations</h2>
    <p>
        You can retrieve a list of Registrations for your application.
        The following code hands back the full list.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="list1"></div>
    <p>
        You can then iterate over the list to pick at what you'd like.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="list2"></div>
    <p>
        Retrieving the full list is potentially an expensive operation, depending how many items you have.
        The more your retrieve, the more data goes over the wire and so forth.  Thus, you might wish to
        <i>paginate</i> your call and retrieve a subset of the total list at a time.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Here is an example that retrieves in pages of size 10.
        It starts on the second page (by skipping to starting index 20).
        It also sorts by the <code>title</code> field in a descending sequence.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="list3"></div>
    <p>
        You don't have to have all of the pagination parameters (<code>limit</code>, <code>skip</code> and <code>sorting</code>).
        You might only want to include one or two.  It's up to you.
    </p>

    <h2 id="query">Query Registrations</h2>
    <p>
        You can run custom queries against your Registrations to find exactly what you're looking for.
        Here is a query that looks for Registrations which are disabled.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="query1"></div>
    <p>
        Here is that same query followed by an iteration over the result map.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="query2"></div>
    <p>
        Finally, you can mix queries with pagination to reduce data over the wire and speed up performance.
        Here is that same query with some pagination thrown in.
        We limit to pages of size 10 and sort by <code>title</code>.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="query3"></div>

    <h2 id="sendconfirmationemail">Send the Confirmation Email</h2>
    <p>
        The first step in the registration process is to send a Confirmation Email.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="sendconfirmationemail1"></div>

    <h2 id="confirm">Confirm the Registration</h2>
    <p>
        Once the end user clicks the link in their email, they come back into your application.  You do what you
        have to do, update the Registration object and then confirm the registration.  By confirming, you tell
        Cloud CMS to proceed and create any user objects, tenant objects and required billing objects.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Once Cloud CMS finishes, it will send the welcome email to the user.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="confirm1"></div>

    <h2 id="sendwelcomeemail">Send the Welcome Email</h2>
    <p>
        If you wish to send the welcome email again, you can do so at any time.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="sendwelcomeemail1"></div>





    <h2 id="example1">Example: Tenant Creation with Payment Method</h2>
    <p>
        Here is a full example where we use a registration flow to register a new sub-tenant for our platform.
        This flow will send all the appropriate emails and create a payment method for the user.
    </p>
    <h3>First Step - Kick off the Registration Process</h3>
    <p>
        Suppose our application has asked the user to provide their email, first name and last name.
        We might collect those values from a form.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        To kick off the registration process, we need to create a registration object as shown below.  The code
        below provides a good sample of how you can do this.  It loads two templates by opening URL connections
        to <code>confirmation.html</code> and <code>welcome.html</code>.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="example1-p1"></div>
    <p>
        The <code>confirmation.html</code> and <code>welcome.html</code> HTML files might be something like this:
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="example1-p1" fileext="html"></div>
    <p>
        The templates are loaded and then the registration is created.  The user's first name and last name
        are copied into the <code>userProperties</code> field.  Finally, the registration confirmation
        emails are sent off.
    </p>
    <h3>Second Step - User Clicks on the Email Link</h3>
    <p>
        The user then receives the email and clicks on the link.  This takes them back into the web application.
        You can then grab the <code>hash</code> request parameter argument and use it to retrieve the
        registration object.
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="example1-p2"></div>
    <h3>Third Step - Collect Additional Info and Confirm Registration</h3>
    <p>
        And then you can present the user with a screen to collect any additional information you wish.
        Fundamentally, we need to ask what <code>password</code> they would like.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        In addition, let's assume that our plan requires billing and thus a payment method.
        We therefore need to collect credit card information which, at a minimum, must include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>holderName</code> - the card holder name</li>
        <li><code>number</code> - the card number</li>
        <li><code>expirationMonth</code> - the two digit expiration month</li>
        <li><code>expirationYear</code> - the four digit expiration year</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Once they click "Submit", we can confirm the registration and create their account.
        The code to do so might look like the following:
    </p>
    <div gadget="codesnippet" snippetId="example1-p3"></div>

    <h2 id="email-templates">Email Templates</h2>
    <p>
        As shown above, you can define your own <code>confirmation</code> and <code>welcome</code> emails using
        templates that take advantage of model variables.  The model will consist of some of the fields from your
        registration object so that you can utilize these fields in your email responses.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Specifically, the following email model variables are available:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>id</b> - the ID of the registration object</li>
        <li><b>_doc</b> - the ID of the registration object</li>
        <li><b>hash</b> - the generated registration hash (this should be used to pass back to your web app)</li>
        <li><b>title</b> - the optional title of your registration object</li>
        <li><b>description</b> - the optional description of your registration object</li>
        <li><b>userName</b> - the name of the user principal</li>
        <li><b>userEmail</b> - the email of the user principal</li>
        <li><b>userProperties</b> - the optional collection of additional user properties</li>
        <li><b>signupProperties</b> - the optional collection of additional signup properties</li>
        <li><b>tenantTitle</b> - the optional tenant title</li>
        <li><b>tenantDescription</b> - the optional tenant description</li>
        <li><b>tenantPlanKey</b> - the optional tenant plan key</li>
    </ul>
